llamafile lets you distribute and run LLMs with a single file. (announcement blog post)

Our goal is to make open LLMs much more accessible to both developers and end users. We're doing that by combining llama.cpp with Cosmopolitan Libc into one framework that collapses all the complexity of LLMs down to a single-file executable (called a "llamafile") that runs locally on most computers, with no installation.

# ü¶ô **Llamafile - A Mozilla Builders Project**  

Llamafile makes it easy to run powerful language models locally on your machine. No cloud dependencies, no data leaving your computer ‚Äî just pure performance in your hands.
